## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your local machine:
* [Flutter SDK](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install) (v3.0+)
* [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (v3.14+)
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

---

### 1️⃣ Backend Setup (Django)

1. **Navigate to the backend directory:**
   ```bash
   cd backend

```
 2. **Create and activate a virtual environment:**
   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use: .venv\Scripts\activate
   
   ```
 3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   
   ```
 4. **Apply database migrations:**
   ```bash
   python manage.py migrate
   
   ```
 5. **Run the local development server:**
   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   
   ```
   *The API will be available at http://127.0.0.1:8000*
### 2️⃣ Frontend Setup (Flutter)
 1. **Navigate to the frontend directory:**
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   
   ```
 2. **Fetch Flutter packages:**
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   
   ```
 3. **Configure the API URL:**
   Locate your API configuration file in the Flutter code and ensure it points to your local Django server (http://10.0.2.2:8000 for Android emulators) or the live Render URL.
 4. **Run the app:**
   ```bash
   flutter run
   
   ```
## 🤖 CI/CD Pipeline & Automated Builds
This repository utilizes **GitHub Actions** to automate the mobile build process.
Whenever code is pushed to the new_frontend branch, the pipeline automatically:
 1. Provisions an Ubuntu runner with Java 17.
 2. Installs the stable Flutter channel.
 3. Retrieves all dependencies inside the frontend/ directory.
 4. Compiles a fresh app-debug.apk.
 5. Uploads the APK as an accessible Artifact in the GitHub Actions tab.
## 🌐 Live Deployment
 * **Backend API:** Hosted on Render
 * The backend is configured with ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['*'] and django-cors-headers to accept requests from the mobile application.
 * *Note: Render free tier instances spin down after 15 minutes of inactivity. The first request may take ~50 seconds to wake the server.*
